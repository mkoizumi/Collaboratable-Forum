## Intro

Collaboratable is a web application where users can register, sign-in/out, submit posts and respond to posts. Front-end uses HTML, CSS and Bootstraps, and back-end is written in Python with Django framework. The primary purpose is to be used in educational settings. Through Collaboratable, students can post questions or thorughts about the class, and other students in class or instructor can start a discussion. Currently reaching out to my school's faculties to use this program in their classes!
